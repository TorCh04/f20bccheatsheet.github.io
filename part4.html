        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Definition:</strong> CAs are models of <strong>distributed emergent behaviour</strong> operating on a grid (1D, 2D, or more dimensions) over <strong>discrete time steps</strong>. Complex behavior emerges from simple, identical <strong>update rules</strong> applied to a local <strong>neighbourhood</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Use Cases:</strong> Used for modelling <strong>spatial processes</strong> (like forest fires), physical, and biological processes, and solving computational problems.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Elementary CA (ECA):</strong> These are <strong>1D binary CAs</strong> (state is 0 or 1) that use a neighbourhood of size 3. Since <span class="math">\(2^3=8\)</span> patterns map to a binary output, there are <span class="math">\(2^8=256\)</span> possible update rules, each having a unique number (0 to 255). ECA Rule 110 is famously known to be <strong>Turing complete</strong> (capable of universal computation).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Game of Life:</strong> A 2D CA that uses <strong>2 states</strong> and a <strong>Moore neighbourhood</strong> (8 neighbours + cell itself). It is defined by 4 rules (under-population, survival, over-crowding, reproduction). It exhibits <strong>surprisingly complex behaviour</strong> and is <strong>Turing complete</strong>. Moving elements like <strong>gliders</strong> and <strong>spaceships</strong> emerge from its rules.
